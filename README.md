# Duffing---Harmonic-Balance-Method
Find the frequency response function of the system whose equation of motion is given by a Duffing oscillator using harmonic balance method. Show that the system can be considered linear for small amplitudes of vibration and that the phenomena of stiffening and jump appear for larger amplitudes of vibration.
